# idea 1
top down shooter
when you shoot someone you lose control over your character and
gain control of the enemy you shot
when you shoot someone else you, again, switch control
if you leave the body of someone you shot, the character dies
so if you shoot yourself to get back, you cannot shoot anyone, or you die
you have one live (both your body and your "soul" share one)
the goal is to survive as long as possible
before you fire your first shot, you should to position yourself
(maybe add some creative map, obstacles?)

- spawns
    create a set of spawns at which the enemies can appear
- ais
    create multiple ais which control the enemies
    (differntiate with different colors?)
    examples:
        - ai that tries to tackle the player
        - ai that comes close but stops at a distance of x and shoots at the player
        - ai that shoots infront of the player
        - ai that only aims for the body of the player
        - ai that spawns close to the player
- sounds
    create sounds for the game
- map / obstacles / (spawns)
    generate a map so that you have a slightly different game every time you play
- score
    increase score by killing enemies, surviving over time and getting combo kills 
    (shooting players directly after each other, Xms after taking over control, ...)
    - you can chain kills (you shoot 3 times, first shot hits, you take over, 
      then 2nd shot hits, you take over, then 3rd shot hits, you take over)
