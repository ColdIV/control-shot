# idea 1
top down shooter
when you shoot someone you lose control over your charakter and
gain control of the enemy you shot
when you shoot someone else you, again, switch control
if you leave the body of someone you shot, the charakter dies
so if you shoot yourself to get back, you cannot shoot anyone, or you die
you have one live (both your body and your "soul" share one)
the goal is to survive as long as possible
before you fire your first shot, you should to position yourself
(maybe add some creative map, obstacles?)
